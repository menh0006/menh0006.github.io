        </article>
        <p>Hi, my name is Amine. I am currently an <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> student, and
            this is my 1<sup>st</sup> <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page ever. <br>
            I have a bachelor's degree in International Business Management, and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Marketing Management.<br>
            Thanks to my background, I had the opportunity to live and study in four different countries: Morocco (my home country),
            France, Spain and now Canada. <br>
            These exeperiences were all extremely eye opening, and shaped me to who I am today.
        </p>
        <p> Indeed, I now consider myself as a versatile individual and a fast-learner, since
             I am used to adapting myself to various environments and cultures. <br>
             I also speak multiple languages: Native in French, Arabic (Moroccan dialect), English (working proficiency) and Spanish (un poquito). <br>
             In a few months, I will hopefully be speaking five languages once I had wrapped my head around HTML.
