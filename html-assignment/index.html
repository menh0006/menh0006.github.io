             </article>
        <p> Hi, my name is Amine. I am currently an <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> student, and
            this is my 1<sup>st</sup> <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page ever. 
            <br>
            I have a bachelor's degree in International Business Management, and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Marketing Management.
            <br>
            Thanks to my background, I had the opportunity to live and study in four different countries: <em>Morocco</em> (my home country),
            <em>France</em>, <em>Spain</em> and <em>Canada</em>. 
            <br>
            These exeperiences were all extremely eye opening, and shaped me to who I am today.
        </p>
        <p> Indeed, I now consider myself as a versatile individual and a fast-learner, since
             I am used to adapting myself to various environments and cultures.
              <br>
             I also speak multiple languages: Native in French, Arabic (Moroccan dialect), English (working proficiency) and Spanish (un poquito). 
             <br>
             In a few months, I will hopefully be speaking five languages once I have wrapped my head around HTML. 
        </p>
        <p> I will now leave you with one of my many favorite quotes from my favorite author. </p>
            <blockquote>"Accept - <strong><em>then</em></strong> act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. 
                Always work <strong><em>with</em></strong> it, not against it." -<cite>Eckhart Tolle, <em>The Power of Now.</em></cite></blockquote>
       
        <p> Thank you for reading.</p>
            Sincerely, <br> Amine.
