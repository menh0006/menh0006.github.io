            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> Hi, my name is Amine. I am currently an <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> student, and
                    this is my 1<sup>st</sup> <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page ever. 
                    <br>
                    I have a bachelor's degree in International Business Management, and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Marketing Management.
                    <br>
                    Thanks to my background, I had the opportunity to live and study in four different countries: <em>Morocco</em> (my home country),
                    <em>France</em>, <em>Spain</em> and <em>Canada</em>. 
                    <br>
                    These exeperiences were all extremely eye opening, and shaped me to who I am today.
            </p>

            <p> Indeed, I now consider myself as a versatile individual and a fast-learner, since I am used to adapting myself to various environments and cultures.
            <br>I also speak multiple languages: Native in French, Arabic (Moroccan dialect), English (working proficiency) and Spanish (un poquito). 
            <br>In a few months, I will hopefully be speaking five languages once I have wrapped my head around HTML. 
            </p>

            <p> Here is one of my many favorite quotes from this amazing author: </p>

            <blockquote>"Accept - <strong><em>then</em></strong> act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. 
            Always work <strong><em>with</em></strong> it, not against it." -<cite>Eckhart Tolle, <em>The Power of Now.</em></cite>
            </blockquote>
        
            <p>Down below is a picture of one of my favorite spots back in Morocco:</p>

            <p>Here is a list of my hobbies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watching and playing sports.</li>
                    <li>Reading self-help books.</li>
                    <li>Walking in nature.</li>
                </ul>
